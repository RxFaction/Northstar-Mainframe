Project Northstar â€” P2P Streaming Platform

Project Northstar is a prototype peer-to-peer live streaming platform built with WebRTC, WebSockets, and Node.js. It enables users to share live video/audio streams directly with viewers, while also providing a lightweight chat system.

FEATURES

-Live Streaming over LAN
-Peer-to-Peer Connections 
-WebSocket Signaling Server
-Real-Time Chat
-Simple UI
-Modern Interface

HOW IT WORKS

-Node.js WebSocket Server (index.js)
-Runs on port 3000.
-Relays signaling data (offers, answers, ICE candidates).
-Broadcasts chat messages to all clients.
-Web Client (index.html)
-Connects to the signaling server via WebSocket.
-Streamers share their screen/audio using getDisplayMedia().
-Viewers connect and receive the remote stream via WebRTC.
-Integrated chat system for interaction between participants.

GETTING STARTED

-Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/RxFaction/Northstar-Mainframe.git
cd Northstar-Main


-Install dependencies:

ROADMAP

-Authentication & access control
